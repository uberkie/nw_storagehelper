2. Check `requirements.txt` and install dependencies
3. Run the `main.py` script

5. While in in-game chat, type `/brightwood`, `/bw`, `/everfall`, `/ef`, etc. to tell the script what storage you will be browsing.
6. Point mouse over an item and press `[Insert]` key to save that item
7. Wait until you hear "Saved" in your headphones/speakers
8. Results are saved to `storage.xlsx` file
